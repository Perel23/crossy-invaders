# Crossy Invaders — Session Tracker

## Status: Step 12 complete — game is feature-complete

---

## Completed steps

### ✅ Step 1 — Project scaffold (2026-05-20)
- GitHub repo created: https://github.com/Perel23/crossy-invaders
- `bagel.h` copied from moshesu/bagel26 (single header, no full clone needed)
- `lib/SDL` and `lib/SDL_image` added as git submodules
- `CMakeLists.txt` set up (SDL3 + SDL3_image, no Box2D — discrete movement only)
- `Game.h` / `Game.cpp` skeleton: opens window at 60 FPS, exits on ESC
- `Components.h` placeholder created
- `main.cpp` written

---

### ✅ Step 2 — Components + player entity (2026-05-20)
- Bumped `MaxComponents` to 16 in `bagel.h`
- Defined `Transform`, `Drawable`, `LanePos`, `PlayerTag` in `Components.h`
- `PackedStorage` for `LanePos` and `PlayerTag`
- Player entity spawned at bottom-center
- `draw_system` iterates `Transform`+`Drawable` mask, draws colored rectangle placeholder

---

### ✅ Step 3 — Input + player movement (2026-05-21)
- `InputState` component: up/down/left/right/shoot/activate + debounce flags
- `input_system`: reads SDL keyboard state → writes `InputState`
- `player_move_system`: one tile hop per keypress, clamped to grid bounds

---

### ✅ Step 4 — Enemy formation (2026-05-21)
- `EnemyTag` + `Health` components
- Enemies spawned in a grid (2 rows × 8 cols) near the top
- `enemy_move_system`: Space Invaders side-step + drop-a-lane on edge hit (600 ms timer)

---

### ✅ Step 5 — Shooting (2026-05-21)
- `BulletTag` + `Velocity` components
- `shoot_system`: player fires up on Space; lowest-lane enemy fires down on 1200 ms timer
- `bullet_system`: moves bullets by velocity each frame, despawns off-screen

---

### ✅ Step 6 — Collision + end states (2026-05-21)
- `collision_system`: bullet×enemy, bullet×player (shield-aware), enemy×player
- Post-hit invincibility frames (90 frames) prevent rapid damage stacking
- GAME OVER / YOU WIN overlay using `SDL_RenderDebugText` at 4× scale
- R key restarts the game

---

### ✅ Step 7 — Lane hazards + HUD (2026-05-21)
- `Hazard` component; 2 hazard lanes (lanes 4 and 6) with 2 cars each, screen-wrap
- `hazard_move_system`: continuous pixel movement
- HUD: 3 HP icons + 2 shield-charge icons in top-left corner

---

### ✅ Step 8 — Iron Dome shield (2026-05-21)
- `Shield` component: timer (frames) + charges remaining
- `shield_system`: I key activates, 5-second timer, 2 charges per life
- Blue halo drawn around player while shield is active
- Shield absorbs enemy bullets with no HP loss

---

### ✅ Step 9 — Shelters (2026-05-21)
- `Shelter` component; 3 shelters on lane 3, HP = 5 each
- Collision pass checks bullet×shelter before bullet×player — shelters actually provide cover
- Shelter color shades from light grey (full HP) to dark grey (nearly destroyed)
- Layout overhauled: 1024×768, 64px tiles, spacious lane spacing

---

### ✅ Step 10 — Character select screen (2026-05-21)
- `GameState` enum: `Select` → `Playing`
- Select screen: two colored boxes (Trump = orange, Bibi = blue), arrow keys to choose, ENTER to confirm
- Player's in-game color matches chosen character
- R after game over returns to character select

---

### ✅ Step 11 — Polish & Gameplay Improvements (2026-05-26)
- **Lane background**: each lane now has a distinct colour (dark green safe zone, asphalt road lanes with dashed centre-lines, dark-red enemy zone, divider lines between every lane)
- **Level splash**: `GameState::LevelTransition` state; after clearing a wave a 150-frame "LEVEL X / Get ready…" overlay is shown before the next wave spawns — uses a `LevelSplash` ECS component with a `splash_system` that calls `spawn_entities()` when it expires
- **Score**: `_score` increments by `10 × level` per enemy kill; displayed as `SCORE 00000` centred at the top of the HUD each frame
- **Level number**: shown as `LVL X` in the HUD bottom-left area
- **Multiple enemy shooters**: instead of always shooting from one fixed enemy, the system now finds all enemies on the front row and picks one at random each volley — shots come from varied horizontal positions
- **Boss spread shot**: on level 3 the boss fires three bullets simultaneously at dx = −2.5, 0, +2.5 pixels/frame
- **Boss health bar**: a full-width red bar below the HUD icons shows remaining boss HP during level 3
- **Random hazard positions**: car starting X coordinates are randomised via `std::rand()` each time `spawn_entities()` runs; base speed scales with level (`+0.6 px/frame per level`)

## Next step to do → Step 12: Sound & Final Polish

**Goal**: Add audio feedback and tighten the overall feel.

**What to do**:
1. Add SDL_mixer (or SDL3 audio) as a submodule; load and play sound effects for: shoot, enemy hit, player hit, level clear, game over
2. Add a high-score display on the game-over / win screen (persist to a file or keep session-best in memory)
3. Animate the character select screen (show actual player sprites in the selection boxes)
4. Add a brief screen-flash effect when the player takes damage (red tint overlay for ~10 frames)

**Why**: Sound and tactile feedback are the last major gap between "functional prototype" and "feels like a real game".

**Definition of done**: Every major game event has a sound; the select screen shows sprites; damage flash is visible.
